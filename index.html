    <h1>Who Moderates My Posts and Timeline?</h1>

    <div class="overview">
        <p>Moderation on the Fediverse is decentralized: each server (also called an "instance") has its own moderators.</p>
        <p>
        Moderators do the difficult behind-the-scenes work of keeping unwanted content off their server and out of its members timelines.
        This tool helps you see how the moderation decisions made across the Fediverse come together to influence your personal timeline.

                    Your local administrators are responsible for maintaining community standards on the server.
                    They can <b>block</b> or <b>suspend</b> accounts, and they can <b>delete</b> posts.
                    They can also <b>block individual users</b> from other servers from appearing on yours or <b>block entire servers</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moderation is a big job, and the amount of work your administrators and moderators have to do depends largely on the number of <b>active users</b> on your server and how much they <b>post</b>.
                    Moderation reports regarding your posts can also come in from any of the <b>peer servers</b> across the Fediverse.

                    When your post is sent to followers on other servers, it is moderated by those servers' administrators.

                  Posts from the accounts you follow are moderated by the individual servers that host them.

                  In addition, the accounts you follow may be <b>suspended</b> by the administrators of their servers, or have their <b>posts deleted</b> by their server's moderators if they do not meet that community's standards.

        <h2>Decentralized Moderation</h2>
        <p>
           Moderation is a difficult task, and many decisions regarding what content meets community standards are inherently subjective.
           One of the strengths of the Fediverse is the large and diverse set of communities, each with its own standards.
        </p>
        <p>
           You can help your moderators by reporting unwanted content when you see it.
           Some servers accept donations, and may even be looking for volunteers to help moderate.
           Moderation can be a thankless job - try thanking your moderators for the work they do!

        <h3>How Does This Work?</h3>
        <p>
            This tool works by querying the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/">public Mastodon APIs</a> on the account's server; thus, at this time,
            it is only expected to work with Mastodon instances (sorry).
            It does so without authenticating, so it can only see information made public by the server admins and/or account holders.
            Some servers do not publicly
            report information such as activity, and some accounts have their
            following and followers relationships hidden.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            All work is done entirely in your browser; no information is sent
            to the operator of this website. The only server contacted is the
            one that hosts the account.
         </p>
