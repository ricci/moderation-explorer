    <h1>Who Moderates My Posts and Timeline?</h1>

    <div class="overview">
        <p>
            Moderation on the Fediverse is decentralized. Each community makes its own rules and has its own moderators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moderators do important work that often happens behind the scenes.
            They follow their community’s rules to remove harmful or unwanted content and to help people treat each other with respect.
            This tool helps you see how moderation choices made by different communities on the Fediverse affect what shows up in your timeline.

                    Your local administrators are responsible for maintaining community rules on the server.
                    They can take actions like <b>blocking</b> or <b>suspending</b> accounts, <b>deleting</b> posts,
                    or limiting access from <b>individual accounts</b> or <b>whole servers</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Running a community takes time and effort.
                    The amount of work depends on things like how many <b>users are active</b>, how many <b>posts are made</b>, and how many reports come in from users or moderators on <b>peer servers</b> across the wider Fediverse.

                <p>
                    When you publish a post, your server sends it to the servers where your followers are.
                    Each server in the Fediverse works on its own.
                    This means that even if a post is allowed on your server, it might be handled differently on other servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The moderators on those servers may use their own rules to check the post.
                    They might <b>filter</b> it, <b>hide</b> it, or even <b>block</b> it if it breaks their community standards.
                    They can <b>block your account</b>, or your entire <b>server</b> and everyone on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have a lot of followers on a certain server, your posts are more likely to be checked by that server’s moderators. The table shows which servers share your posts the most.

                  The accounts you follow might also be <b>removed</b> or have their <b>posts deleted</b> if they break that server’s community guidance.

        <h2>Decentralized Moderation</h2>
        <p>
          Every server in the Fediverse has its own rules and moderation style.
          These are based on what the community values and needs.
          This variety is one of the strengths of decentralized platforms. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Moderation is important, but it can also be hard work and stressful or upsetting.
          About 99% of Fediverse moderators are volunteers, and around 1 in 5 report feeling burned out or traumatized each year. 
        </p>
        <p>
           You can help by reporting content that breaks your server’s rules.
           Some servers accept donations, and may even be looking for volunteers to help moderate.
           Simply thanking your moderators can make a real difference!

        <h3>How Does This Work?</h3>
        <p>
            This tool works by querying the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/">public Mastodon APIs</a> on the account's server; thus, at this time,
            it is only expected to work with Mastodon instances (sorry).
            It does so without authenticating, so it can only see information made public by the server admins and/or account holders.
            Some servers do not publicly
            report information such as activity, and some accounts have their
            following and followers relationships hidden.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            All work is done entirely in your browser; no information is sent
            to the operator of this website. The only server contacted is the
            one that hosts the account.
         </p>
