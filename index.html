    <h1>Who Moderates My Posts and Timeline?</h1>

    <div class="overview">
        <p>Moderation on the Fediverse is decentralized.</p>
        <p>
        Your Mastodon account is moderated by the administrators of the server where it resides.
Likewise, the people you follow‚Äîand those who follow you‚Äîare subject to the moderation policies of their own servers.
This tool helps you see which moderators influence what you can say and what you see across the Fediverse.

                    As with all servers, your local administrators can <b>block</b>
                    or <b>suspend</b> your account, and they can <b>delete</b> your posts. They can also <b>block individual users</b>
                    from other servers from appearing on yours or <b>block entire servers</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of work your administrators and moderators have to do depends largely on the number of <b>active users</b>
                    on your server and how much they <b>post</b>. Moderation reports regarding your posts can also come in from any of the
                    <b>peer servers</b> across the fediverse.

                    Whether or not the accounts that follow you actually see your posts is dependent on the moderation
                    of the individual servers that they are on.
                    Servers can independently <b>block your account</b> from appearing on their server, or
                    <b>block your entire server</b>. The more accounts following you on a specific server, the
                    more control that server's administrators and moderators have over whether you can reach their users.

                  Your ability to see posts from the accounts you follow is also
                   dependent on the moderation of the individual servers that they are on.
                  As with your followers, servers can independently <b>block your account</b> from fetching posts or
                          <b>block your entire server</b>. In addition, the accounts you follow may be <b>suspended</b> by the administrators of their servers,
                          or have their <b>posts deleted</b> by their server's moderators.
                  As with followers, the more accounts you follow on a server, the
                  more control that server's administrators and moderators have over what you see.

        <h3>How Does This Work?</h3>
        <p>
            This tool works by querying the <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/api/">public Mastodon APIs</a> on the account's server; thus, at this time,
            it is only expected to work with Mastodon instances (sorry).
            It does so without authenticating, so it can only see information made public by the server admins and/or account holders.
            Some servers do not publicly
            report information such as activity, and some accounts have their
            following and followers relationships hidden.
        </p>

        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            All work is done entirely in your browser; no information is sent
            to the operator of this website. The only server contacted is the
            one that hosts the account.
         </p>
